- SS active low
- sampling is rising edge of clock
- output (bit changes) happens on falling edge of clock
- return 10 bit value
	- Arduino Uno int is 16 bits
- minimum clock speed for reliable reading - 10kHz 
	- T = 0.1ms = 100 microseconds
	- does not have to be constant
	- max digitalWrite() frequency
		- 148kHz on non-PWM pin
		- 106.8kHz on PWM pin
	- use approximately 20kHz for SCLK
		- 50 microseconds per cycle
		- 25 microseconds per half cycle
		- delayMicroseconds(25)
		- will be slowed to under 20kHz because of other instructions, but should still be above 10kHz
	

start bit - Din high
- can have low before for as many clocks as necessary
